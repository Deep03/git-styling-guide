# üìù Git Commit Style Guide

This guide follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for writing clear, consistent, and meaningful commit messages.

---

## üìå Commit Message Format

```

<type>(optional-scope): <short summary>

\[optional body]

\[optional footer: issues, breaking changes]

````

- Use the **imperative mood** (e.g., "fix", "add", "refactor" ‚Äî not "fixed" or "adds")
- Keep the **summary line under 50 characters**
- Separate header from body with a **blank line**
- Wrap the body at **72 characters** if needed
